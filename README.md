# PHP Test Project

### Description
At Better Stack, we don‚Äôt just ship features‚Äîwe craft great products. This assignment is about more than just checking off tasks; it‚Äôs your opportunity to show us how you think, how you build, and how you care about user experience.

We ask you to build a very simple one-page application consisting of a single table and a form for creating new rows. To make it a little more complicated, we have written a 'framework' you have to use. Please write production-ready code.


### Installation
1. Create a private GitHub repository and invite @jurajmasar and @gyfis and @KubqoA as collaborators
2. Create a new MySQL database
3. Rename `config/database` to `config/database.php` and configure your database connection settings in this file
4. Import `database/schema.sql` into your database

### What we‚Äôre looking for
We want to see how you approach building software that real users would enjoy using. Treat this as if it were a real-world product for adding users to a table. 

We expect you to spend no more than 4 hours on this project. That means you‚Äôll need to prioritize, make trade-offs, and focus on what matters‚Äîjust like in real-world product development. 

Try your best to show us you are the engineer who knows when to go ‚Äúquick and dirty‚Äù and¬†when to polish production code to perfection, as described in this post: https://juraj.blog/p/two-sides

Please, start with these:
  * Styling the page using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  * Adding validation of new records
  * Creating a JS search functionality that allows users to filter records by city
  * Implementing form submission using AJAX
  * Adding a phone number column to the table
  * Deploying your project and sending us a production link
  * ‚Ä¶ however, this is not a perfect checklist. So please, don‚Äôt limit yourself to these points‚Äîengineering at Better Stack isn‚Äôt about simply completing a list of tasks. It‚Äôs about engineers shipping a great piece of software end-to-end that people will actually enjoy using!

We‚Äôre looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
Thank you! üôè
